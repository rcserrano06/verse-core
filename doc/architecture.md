# Architecture Overview

Verse Core is designed as a modular, event-driven microservice framework with a clear separation of concerns. This document provides an overview of the architecture and how the different components interact.

## High-Level Architecture

Verse Core consists of several key components that work together to provide a complete framework for building microservices:

1. **Core Module**: Foundation of the framework
2. **Event System**: Communication between services
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic
4. **Model Layer**: Data persistence and retrieval
5. **Exposition Layer**: External API exposure
6. **Authentication & Authorization**: Security
7. **Plugin System**: Extensibility

## Key Components

### Core

The core module (`Verse::Core`) provides the foundation for the framework, including initialization, configuration, and service identification. It manages the startup and shutdown sequences, ensuring all components are properly initialized and terminated.

### Event System

The event system (`Verse::Event`) enables communication between services through an event-driven architecture. It supports different modes of event handling:

- **Broadcast Mode**: Events are shared across multiple instances of a service
- **Consumer Mode**: Events are consumed by only one instance of a service
- **Command Mode**: Events require a reply

The event system is designed to be pluggable, allowing different implementations (local, Redis, etc.) through a common interface.

### Service Layer

The service layer (`Verse::Service`) contains the business logic of the application. Services are responsible for orchestrating operations, interacting with repositories, and publishing events. They provide a clean API for the exposition layer.

### Model Layer

The model layer (`Verse::Model`) handles data persistence and retrieval. It consists of:

- **Records**: Immutable data objects with field definitions and relationship mappings
- **Repositories**: Data access objects that provide CRUD operations and query capabilities

The model layer supports different storage backends through a common interface.

### Exposition Layer

The exposition layer (`Verse::Exposition`) exposes services to the outside world. It handles request processing, authentication, and response formatting. The exposition layer uses a handler chain pattern to process requests.

### Authentication & Authorization

The auth system (`Verse::Auth`) provides authentication and authorization capabilities. It supports:

- Role-based access control
- Resource and action-based permissions
- Scope-based filtering

### Plugin System

The plugin system (`Verse::Plugin`) enables extensibility through plugins. Plugins can hook into different parts of the framework and provide additional functionality. The plugin system manages the lifecycle of plugins and their dependencies.

## Flow of Control

1. A request enters the system through the exposition layer
2. The exposition layer authenticates the request and creates an auth context
3. The exposition layer routes the request to the appropriate service
4. The service performs business logic, interacting with repositories as needed
5. The service may publish events to notify other services
6. The service returns a response to the exposition layer
7. The exposition layer formats the response and returns it to the client

## Design Principles

Verse Core is built on several key design principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through events
3. **Pluggability**: Components can be replaced with different implementations
4. **Testability**: Components are designed to be easily testable
5. **Extensibility**: The framework can be extended through plugins
