# Core Concepts

This document explains the fundamental concepts of the Verse Core framework.

## Service-Oriented Architecture

Verse Core is designed around a service-oriented architecture (SOA) where functionality is divided into distinct services that communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces. This approach promotes:

- **Modularity**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Reusability**: Services can be reused across different parts of the application
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one service don't affect others as long as the interface remains stable

## Event-Driven Communication

Services communicate with each other through events, which are messages that represent something that has happened in the system. This event-driven approach provides:

- **Loose coupling**: Services don't need to know about each other directly
- **Scalability**: Events can be processed asynchronously
- **Resilience**: Services can continue to function even if other services are unavailable

## Domain-Driven Design

Verse Core encourages domain-driven design (DDD) principles, where the structure and language of the code reflect the business domain. Key DDD concepts in Verse Core include:

- **Entities**: Represented by Records with unique identities
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects with no identity
- **Repositories**: Provide access to entities
- **Services**: Encapsulate business logic that doesn't naturally fit into entities or value objects

## Layered Architecture

Verse Core uses a layered architecture to separate concerns:

- **Exposition Layer**: Handles external communication and request processing
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic
- **Model Layer**: Manages data persistence and retrieval

This separation makes the codebase more maintainable and testable.

## Plugin System

The plugin system allows extending the framework with additional functionality. Plugins can:

- Add new capabilities to the framework
- Integrate with external systems
- Modify the behavior of existing components

## Authentication and Authorization

Verse Core provides a comprehensive authentication and authorization system:

- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of users
- **Authorization**: Controls what authenticated users can do
- **Scoping**: Limits what data users can access

## Configuration

Verse Core uses a flexible configuration system that allows:

- Environment-specific configuration
- Service-specific configuration
- Plugin configuration

## Error Handling

Verse Core provides a structured approach to error handling:

- **Error classes**: Specific error types for different situations
- **Error propagation**: Errors are propagated through the layers
- **Error handling**: Errors can be handled at different levels

## Testing

Verse Core is designed to be testable, with support for:

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- End-to-end testing
